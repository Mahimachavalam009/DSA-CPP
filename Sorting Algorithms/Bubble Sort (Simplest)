 Bubble Sort (Step-by-Step Explanation)
ðŸ’¡ Logic:

Compare adjacent elements
If left > right, swap them
Keep repeating until the array is sorted

ðŸ”¹ Example
Unsorted Array â†’ [4, 2, 8, 1]
Let's go step by step:
Pass1:
(4, 2) â†’ Swap â†’ [2, 4, 8, 1]
(4, 8) â†’ No Swap
(8, 1) â†’ Swap â†’ [2, 4, 1, 8]
ðŸ”¹ Largest element 8 is now at the right place.

Pass 2:
(2, 4) â†’ No Swap
(4, 1) â†’ Swap â†’ [2, 1, 4, 8]
ðŸ”¹ 4 is now at the right place.

Pass 3 :
(2, 1) â†’ Swap â†’ [1, 2, 4, 8]
âœ… Sorted Array â†’ [1, 2, 4, 8]
