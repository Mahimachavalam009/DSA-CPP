 Logic:

Find the minimum element and swap it with the first unsorted position
Repeat for the rest of the array

ðŸ”¹ Example
Unsorted Array â†’ [4, 2, 8, 1]

Pass 1:
Smallest element 1 found â†’ Swap with 4
âœ… [1, 2, 8, 4]
Pass 2:
Smallest in remaining part â†’ 2 (already correct)
Pass 3:
Smallest in remaining part â†’ 4 â†’ Swap with 8
âœ… [1, 2, 4, 8]
